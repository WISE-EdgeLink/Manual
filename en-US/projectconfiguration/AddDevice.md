## Add Device

There are two ways to add device to a created project

- Add blank device: After adding, all configurations are empty, and the user can manually configure it, please refer to Section [2.1.2.1](../projectconfiguration/Configuration(1).html) for specific steps
- Copy from existing device: When adding, you can copy and add the device that has been configured in the project, and you can copy each other regardless of the device model, but because the number of hardware interfaces between different models of device is different, the actual copy content is determined by the final device type, and the specific steps can refer to Section [2.1.2.2](../projectconfiguration/AddDevice2.html)
