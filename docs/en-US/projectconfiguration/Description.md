In an on-site application, one or several RTU devices may have been installed. If there is a tool which manages to carry out the configuration and management of these RTU devices as well as the whole project, the customers will definitely benefit a lot from it. Therefore, we have developed EdgeLink Studio to configure and manage the devices and the project which may have multiple devices under it.
