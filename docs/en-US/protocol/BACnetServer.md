## BACnet Server ã€€


EdgeLink can work as BACnet Server to exchange data with BACnet Client of HMI/SCADA. Current version of BACnet server is designed to conform to BACnet Advanced Application Controller (B-AAC) level. 

Here will explain the application of BACnet Server in detail.

1. Double-click "BACnet Server" under "Service" item in the left menu tree to pop up the configuration interface.
