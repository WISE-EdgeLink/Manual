## DO data acquisition and parameter settingã€€

1. The data of the DO module is displayed in the following figure. The data form items are as follows:

- Slot number: The module where the DO function block is located, slot 0 is onboard.

- Channel number: DO channel number.

- Mode: Normal (i.e. DO) or PWM.

- Signal Status: DO port level value.

- Value: When in Normal mode, the output DO value is displayed here; Counter mode, the count value is displayed here.

- Low width: The low level pulse width of the output in PWM mode.

- High width: The high-level pulse width of the output in PWM mode.

3. PWM mode:

- PWM output: green is enabled, red is not enabled

- PWM value: Set the number of output PWM waveforms, the default is 0, 0 means always output

- Low signal width: The low level pulse width of the output PWM in 0.1ms, and the pulse width is (0.1* number) ms

- High signal width: The high level pulse width of the output PWM is 0.1ms, and the pulse width is (0.1* number) ms
