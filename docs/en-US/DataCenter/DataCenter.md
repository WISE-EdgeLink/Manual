## Data Acquisition Configuration

Data acquisition is an important function for RTU devices. EdgeLink supports the acquisition of onboard IO, extended IO, IO of serial devices, Ethernet devices to satisfy the diversified acquisition needs. Therefore in EdgeLink Studio, users need to add and configure those tags based on the specific acquisition requirements.

These IO tags added into the project are real tags; while in actual project deployment, local tags of engineering significance are also needed. Users are required to add and configure them in EdgeLink Studio.
