2. Detailed description of tag point configuration

    There are three types of Tag.

      A.	Read Only Tag
              Format: R:Read Address / Read Data Type / Read Command  
              Example: R:402 / M_BO_NA_1 / n

      B.	Write Only Tag
              Format: W:Write Address / Write Command  
              Example: W:2300 / C_RC_NA_1
              Note: Always show value 0 for this kind of tag

      C.	Read And Write Tag
              Format: R:Read Address / Read Data Type / Read Command / W:Write Address / Write Command 
              Example: R:400 / M_BO_NA_1 / n / W:2400 / n

**Note**: Add /SE after Write Command to change “Direct Execute” to “Select and Execute”
- Read And Write Tag
Format: R:Read Address / Read Data Type / Read Command / W:Write Address / Write Command / SE
Example: R:100 / M_SP_NA_1 / n / W:2100 / n / SE
- Write Only Tag
Format: W:Write Address / Write Command / SE
Example: W:2100 / C_SC_NA_1 / SE
